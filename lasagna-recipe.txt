Bolognese sauce:
1-1/4 lbs. ground chuck/brisket blend
1 jar sauce (I like Fairway brand Roasted Garlic) or homemade marinara sauce

Lasagna filling:
1 lb. fresh ricotta (or regular if you must)
1 egg, beaten
1/4 c. milk
1/2 c. grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese
2   T Greek yogurt
2   t oregano
2   t basil
1/2 t garlic powder
1/4 t ground pepper
1/8 t salt

1 lb. fresh mozzarella, shredded
1 lb. lasagna noodles, cooked to direction and cooled on wax paper

Brown beef in a large skillet over high heat, about 7 minutes, pour off most, but not all, the fat
Add sauce to pan, reduce heat, and simmer covered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has noticeably thickened, about 45 minutes.

Combine remaining ingredients except noodles and mozzarella in a bowl and mix well.
Preheat oven to 350F (~180C).
Spread a very thin layer of sauce in a large, deep glass casserole dish.
Place noodles in a single layer in dish.
Spread ricotta mixture evenly over noodles. (If the mixture doesn't spread, thin with additional milk.)
Add a layer of sauce and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella.
Repeat an addition two or three layers of noodles, ricotta, sauce, and mozzarella, depending on depth of dish.
Cover top layer with mozzarella and grated cheese.

Bake in oven for 30-40 minutes until sauce is bubbling and cheese has melted.
If desired, place under broiler for a couple of minutes to brown cheese on top.
